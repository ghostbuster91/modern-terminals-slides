# modern-terminals-slides

My dot-files configuration used for the purpose of that presentation: https://github.com/ghostbuster91/dot-files/tree/presentation

The tool I used to present slides is called [lookatme](https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme).

You can install it using nix: `nix-shell -p lookatme`
